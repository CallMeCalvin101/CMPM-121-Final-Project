## Tools and materials
We decided to use Unity to make a 2d game. We chose Unity because there isn't a lot of overlap between the engines that we know between us and some of us are more experienced and comfortable woth Unity than Phaser.

For Unity, we'll mostly be using C# as that is the language that Unity uses. We chose to use these lanaguages because a lot of us have past experience with them due to our past game projects and/or previous classes that taught them.

I expect us to use Visual Studio 2022 as that is the default IDE for Unity or maybe some of us will stick with Visual Studio Code instead. We want to keep our options open so we are considering form multiple sources like Tiled, the Unity Store, or other sources we find while doing research that seems promising. We have experience with Tiled from CMPM120 and some of us have experience with the Unity Asset Store as well so if any of our members don't know how to use it, we can help them.

## Outlook
We anticipate the hardest part of this assignment to be the suprise requirements. The suprise requirements might cause us to redo and reformat a lot of our code in the future to meet the conditions and might even cause us to completely start from the ground up if the requirement is too out-of-the-way for our current code. 
Through this project, we hope to hone our programming skills, and train them to be more flexible when suprise changes are needed. We also hope to learn more about our programming engine and how to work as a team to produce a game.
